			<h2>Marilyn</h2>
			<p><img src="marilyn.jpg" alt="Marilyn headshot" width="600" height="800" style="float:right; padding: 10px;">
			On September 17, 1947 a baby girl was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. She was the first child born to Eldren Lamar Butler and Evelyn Webb Butler. She was taken home to a duplex apartment on sixth south in Salt Lake City without a name. Her parents didn't agree, Evelyn wanted to name her
			Helen; Eldren wanted to name her Mary Lynn. She remained nameless for several weeks until someone suggested the name Marilyn. The parents could agree on that name; however, Marilyn remembers being called Mary Lynn by
			her father many times in her early life.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			That duplex apartment was located right next door to Eldren's parents--Edgar and May Butler. Although Marilyn doesn't have many memories from the time, she does remember  having a strong emotional bond with her 
			Grandma Butler. The family moved to Clearfield Utah just before Marilyn celebrated her second birthday.  They moved into a rented home so Eldren could teach fifth grade at Clinton Elementary. Clearfield became the
			long time residence of the family after the purchase of a home. There weren't many choices for housing in Clearfield, but a partially finished home that had become a bank owned property was located. Eldren spent the
			summer after his first year of teaching getting enough of the house completed that he could move Evelyn, Marilyn, and himself into the home. The Butler's welcomed a son, Van, in March so they were a family of four
			now.
			</p>
			
			<p>Marilyn remembers playing with her younger brother in the living room where there was a big over-stuffed purple couch that was fun to jump off. She and Van were the only children until the arrival of Ruth Ann four
			years after Van. Marilyn didn't play with toy dolls anymore after RuthAnn's birth. Who would want a doll if you could be with a real live baby? Marilyn felt happy to take Ruth Ann with her and was disappointed when
			her little sister expressed her own opinions and didn't go along with Marilyn's choices. The sisters have remained close to each other throughout their lives.
			</p>
			
			<p>Marilyn attended South Clearfield Elementary from first to sixth grade. She remembers the name of each teacher and has fond memories of events that took place with the exception of third grade. In that class was
			a neighbor boy who struggled with reading. Marilyn was a top reader and wanted to help her friend, as she had been encouraged to do in first and second grades. The teacher had different ideas and would yank Marilyn's
			long braids often. At the end of third grade Marilyn asked for her long hair to be cut and has worn it short ever since.
			</p>
			
			<p>Junior High was at North Davis Jr. in Clearfield. Marilyn did well academically but didn't have the social skills she would have liked. Her closest friends were a year behind her in school. She remembers fun times
			spent with Sandra, Renae, Claudia, David, Guy, and Marvin. Sandra and Marvin were grouped with Marilyn for a folk dance which they performed in a large dance festival held at Rice-Eccles Stadium at the University of
			Utah. Practicing and then presenting the dance was an unforgettable experience where Marilyn enjoyed being on a field with hundreds of other dancers.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Marilyn's mom was expecting  a new baby to be born near or on Valentines Day. During the afternoon of Saturday, January 17, Evelyn yelled for Marilyn to find her dad and bring him immediately to the house. Something
			was wrong and they were in the car on the way to Doctor Peterson's office within minutes. Eldren rushed his wife to a hospital in Ogden, Utah where a baby girl was born with specialists attending. She was about a
			month early, weighed 4 pounds, 14 ounces and was 19 inches long. She didn't come home from the hospital with Evelyn, the family returned to Ogden to bring her home when she reached a weight of pounds. Family 
			visitors seeing her for the first time said, "Isn't that a bit of red hair I'm seeing?" Yes, that was red hair. Aleen was the name given this little girl. She had a challenging first year with colic and other
			problems the doctor claimed were related to her premature birth. Evelyn was 47 years old when Aleen was born, and called often for Marilyn' s help
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Aleen's health issues mostly disappeared as she passed her first birthday and she was on her way. She grew, not very tall, but into a healthy, spunky (to match the red hair), intelligent, beloved younger sister
			to her three older siblings. Marilyn felt almost as if Aleen were her child because she did much to help a mom who was older and couldn't keep up with the spunky red headed daughter. Sadly, Aleen died in an accident
			after a successful mission to Japan and just before graduation from Utah State University. Her loss is still deeply felt by her siblings, however they have been comforted by spiritual assurances.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			On with Marilyn's story. She graduated from Clearfield High in 1965, the third graduating class for that high school. In the fall, Marilyn entered Weber State College and began working toward a Bachelor's Degree
			in Elementary Education. That degree was awarded in May 1969. With both parents having taught elementary school and Grandma May Butler also having been a teacher, Marilyn might have thought that career was the only
			possible choice. Marilyn began her teaching career at Syracuse Elementary in August 1969 with a class of second grade students. She taught at Syracuse two more years and then accepted a mission call to serve in the
			France-Switzerland mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. What an incredible learning, growing experience for the 18 months from August 1972 to February 1974. As one might expect, Marilyn 
			returned to Utah with knowledge of a new language (French), strengthened self confidence, and a testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Just about everyone who meets Marilyn learns quickly that she loves anything French (especially chocolate croissants) and that her testimony of Jesus Christ and His church keep her going. Marilyn returned to her
			teaching career after a short 5 month job at a convalescent care center. She was hired to teach kindergarten at Doxey Elementary in Sunset, Utah. An Early Childhood Endorsement was required in addition to the 
			Bachelors Degree. Her principal, Lamar Stuart, one of her father's colleagues in the Davis School District, encouraged and supported her efforts. The needed endorsement was earned and Marilyn remained at Doxey for
			three years. She returned to Syracuse Elementary in 1977 because there was an opening for a first grade teacher and she had really enjoyed the community, including the staff from her earlier time there. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Believe it or not, Marilyn taught at Syracuse Elementary until the spring of 2006, when she retired after 35 years of teaching. From 1977 to 2006 she had taught first, second, and third grades. Not all at the same
			time! Most of those years were spent teaching first or third grades. Those years are, of course, another highlight of Marilyn's life and memories. So many young lives Marilyn had the opportunity to touch and also,
			learn from. Each child had something special to share with Marilyn. As she looks at the many class pictures she has, clear memories of cherished moments come back. There's the kindergarten boy who followed her
			everywhere she went for a school year (including waiting for her outside the bathroom), many bright students who knew more than she did about technology, little ones  who cried every morning until they knew they were
			safe in her classroom, naughty kids who tried her patience until she got to know them well enough to have compassion for their situation. Marilyn remembers them with fondness and appreciation for what she gained from
			each one. She currently resides in Centerville enjoying the retired life.
