			<h2>Ruth Ann</h2>

			I was born in Ogden, Utah on March 27, 1954 the third child of Eldren Lamar and Evelyn Webb Butler. My older siblings are a sister Marilyn and a brother Van. My parents brought me home to Clearfield Utah where I lived
			for the next 18 years. A younger sister, Aleen, was born when I was 5 years old. Our home in Clearfield was close to the elementary school, the junior high, the high school, the local grocery store, the ward church 
			building and stake church building which meant walking was a primary mode of transportation, very handy in a one car family. There were plenty of wide open spaces outside to dig or play in the mud, to 
			run-hop-skip-jump, hide in the weeds, build forts or secret hiding places, watch bugs or play with the cats and lay in the grass to watch the clouds over head.</p>
			
			<p>Both of my parents are from Cache Valley. My mother was from Richmond and my father from Trenton, rural farming communities. Both were raised on small family farms where they learned to work hard and to enjoy
			outdoor pursuits such as gardening. My siblings and I were raised helping with a large garden which provided us with much of the food we ate, summer and winter. We also had chickens to feed, eggs to collect and 
			feathers to pluck from a chicken destined for Sunday dinner that had just lost its head. We had responsibilities and chores to do. My parents were taught to value music by their parents and they made sacrifices to 
			purchase a piano early in their marriage. They began sharing the gift of music with us through teaching and through their own participation. My mother had a beautiful soprano voice and played piano, my father had a 
			wonderful high tenor voice, Marilyn played piano, Van played clarinet briefly, I played violin and piano and Aleen played piano.</p>
			
			<p>School was a good opportunity for each of us to learn and develop skills and friendships. We were being raised by two school teachers so naturally we were expected to apply ourselves and do well in school.  Both 
			my father and mother were elementary educators. My mother quit when they started having children and my father eventually became a principal where he had taught in Clinton, Utah the last 19 years of his career. I 
			enjoyed school generally and had many opportunities over the years with friends and activities. In addition to the required curriculum I was involved in music and in high school performed with the drill team.  The
			names of the schools were South Clearfield Elementary, North Davis Jr. High and Clearfield High School graduation class of 1972.</p>
			
			<p>After high school graduation I began college at Utah State University in Logan, Utah where I majored in music education. I lived away from home in the dorms and learned to share apartment space with roommates who
			came from different backgrounds. It was a time of learning more about the wide world of diversity. The girls in my apartments were good to live with and we brought a wide variety of interests, goals and skills to the
			livings arrangements. At the same time we were on our own to complete our programs and continue in our individual pursuits. That was invigorating, nobody watching over my shoulder or making decisions for me. It was
			all up to me! After 5 years I graduated with a degree in music education and took a teaching job close by in Cache County School District. I was at that job for 4 years before I married.</p>
			
			<p>Robert Bell and I married in 1981 and at the time we both ended up in school at USU. He was completing his bachelors degree and I was back to start a masters program. Before we left Logan he completed his degree and
			I was well on my way to completing a masters degree which was eventually completed in 1988 at the University of Denver. In the mean time he went into the Air Force following his ROTC program in college. We lived in
			Biloxi MS, Shreveport LA, Denver CO and Milpitas CA as we were moved with his assignments in the military. This was another time of change and learning. 10 years and one baby son (Kevin) later, we went through a
			divorce, and I subsequently moved back to Utah with Kevin to be close to family.</p>

			<p>For 10 years in Utah I taught music in schools working as a single mother.  Six of those years Kevin and I lived with my older sister Marilyn because we bought a house together. Kevin did well in school and made many
			friends there, in the neighborhood or at church. We loved our home and felt safe and accepted in our neighborhood. I taught orchestra music at Roy Jr. High, Sandridge Jr. and Roy High School. It always felt like a huge
			challenge to keep up with 3 schools but I persevered and the program grew in numbers and quality. Kevin started on the cello at Roy Jr High eventually earning a music scholarship at USU the year before his mission.
			</p>

			<p>In 2000, I met Stephen Tarbet, through the internet, and gradually became good friends. We started dating and married in 2001. Kevin was going into 8th grade, Marilyn bought a condo and moved to Centerville and
			Stephen moved into our Roy home. The three of us remained there only one year when we sold the home and moved to West Point in a temporary rental for about a year while our new home was being built in Kaysville.
			</p>

			<p>We have now lived in Kaysville for approximately 17 years in the home we built together. Kevin is 31 living here again temporarily, Stephen's children are married and we see them and the grandchildren often. Both
			Stephen and I have retired and we have loved our home and the neighborhood. It has been a good life full of the challenges and successes anyone else may experience. A blessed life!</p>
